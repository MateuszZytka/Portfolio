        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer coding program at University of Toronto School of Continued Studies. I come from a background of working in the trades, specifacally HVAC. My previous field was one of constant learning and problem solving, two traits that I have found to be relatable to learning to code. Learning to work indepentantly as well as part of a team was critical to my former field as the scope of jobs varied heavily. I am excited to start my new journey into the ever changing field of technology. Below you'll find the projects I have worked on so far with more to come!
